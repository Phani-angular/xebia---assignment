A simple app showing available parking spots in a given location( amsterdam in this case)

i have included both bower and node modules to make it easy for the non- tech users

 Assuming you have the node installed on your machine already, navigate to the parking_spots folder in your command promp(windows) or terminal(mac) and run
    1. npm install
    2. bower install
    3. npm start

you will get a console message shown below
